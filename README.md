Pages can be added - in manifest.json - example 
      "matches": ["*://*.nra.lv/*", "*://*.example.com/*"],

Gifs can be added either in content.js or though options from chrome extension button.

2) Go into - chrome://extensions/ 
3) Enable developer mode at top right corner
4) Press on Load Packed button on top left

Enjoy very little less shitty internet.
